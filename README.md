# goodenough_gaia_cmds
*Good enough* automatic cluster membership selection to recover CMDs for use in the classroom!

To install:

import gaiacmds

This code is designed to auto-generate CMDs from Gaia data based on a simple object name search. While not using a sophisiticated selection function suited to *research* purposes, results are good enough for pedagogical use, including explaining SSPs (or CSPs as the case may be), fitting isochrones, and recovering age/distance/metallicity for open and globular clusters.
